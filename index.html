        <div class="box box3">ABOUT ME</div>
        <div class="box box4">I'm originally from Colombia but have lived in Australia for the past 12 years. I worked as a scientist for a few companies and universities in Australia after I finished master's degree in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics. 2020 has been a really challenging year for me, but also has brought some blessings in disguise. Not only I found myself stranded in Europe for almost three months but also as many of you, I lost my job. I'm grateful for the opportunity Generation Australia has given me and I'm very looking forward to starting a new career in web development. Iâ€™ve always been interested in the tech industry and had been wanting to make the switch for quite a few years now</div>
